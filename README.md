A user submits a support request through the ticket web portal. The ticket is assigned to the appropriate support agent or team. Initial communication with the user involves acknowledging the issue and gathering any missing details. This simulates real user experience in a help desk environment.

The assigned agent investigates and troubleshoots the issue, logging updates in the ticket to maintain a clear record of all actions taken. This simulates working the ticket and documentation in a real world environment.

Once the issue is resolved, the agent documents the solution, communicates the outcome to the user, and closes the ticket. A record of the ticket is maintained for future reference and reporting purposes.
